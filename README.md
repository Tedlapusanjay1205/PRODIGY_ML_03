# 🐶🐱 Dogs vs. Cats Image Classification

This repository contains a **Deep Learning project** that classifies images of dogs and cats. The project utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to differentiate between the two classes with high accuracy. The solution is built using **TensorFlow/Keras** and includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## ✨ Features

- **Image Data Preprocessing:** Resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to improve model robustness.  
- **Model Architecture:** Custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or transfer learning using pretrained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet).  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.  
- **Interactive Deployment:** A user-friendly interface for predicting whether an image is a dog or a cat.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab (optional), Flask/Streamlit for deployment

## 📊 Workflow

1. **Dataset Preparation:**  
   - Download the dataset (e.g., from Kaggle’s Dogs vs. Cats dataset).  
   - Split into training, validation, and testing sets.  

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Resize images to a fixed size (e.g., 128x128 or 224x224).  
   - Normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1].  
   - Apply data augmentation (e.g., rotation, flipping) to increase dataset diversity.  

3. **Model Development:**  
   - Build a CNN or use transfer learning (e.g., fine-tuning VGG16).  
   - Compile the model using an appropriate optimizer (e.g., Adam) and loss function (e.g., categorical crossentropy).  

4. **Model Training:**  
   - Train the model with training data and validate on a validation set.  
   - Use early stopping and learning rate scheduling for optimal training.  

5. **Evaluation:**  
   - Test the model on unseen data to calculate accuracy and other metrics.  
   - Visualize training and validation curves.  

6. **Deployment:**  
   - Deploy the model as a web app for users to upload images and get predictions.
